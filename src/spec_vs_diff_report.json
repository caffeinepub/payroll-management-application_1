  "summary": "The diff shows comprehensive implementation of leave day calculations as 8 regular work hours across both backend and frontend. The backend (main.mo) includes logic for handling leave days for both hourly and monthly employees. The frontend includes informational messages in dialogs (WorkDayDialog, LeaveDayDialog, BulkLeaveDayDialog, DailyBulkEntryTable) explaining the 8-hour calculation. All three requirements appear to be implemented with appropriate UI messaging and backend logic.",
