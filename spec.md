# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the Employee Calendar page to match the layout and functionality it had in version 227.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore `CalendarPage.tsx` to its v227 layout, tab structure, and styling
- Restore `BulkEntryTable.tsx` (all employees × days grid) to v227 appearance and inline editing controls
- Restore `DailyBulkEntryTable.tsx` to v227 appearance and inline editing controls
- Restore month/year selectors, normal hours, overtime hours, and leave toggle controls as they were in v227

**User-visible outcome:** The Employee Calendar page displays exactly as it did in version 227, with both bulk entry and daily bulk entry tabs, functional month/year selectors, and working inline editing for normal hours, overtime, and leave toggles. No other pages or functionality are affected.
