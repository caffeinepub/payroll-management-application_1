  "summary": "The diff modifies CalendarPage.tsx to restore the month/year selectors, tab structure (bulk entry and daily bulk entry views), and overall layout matching version 227. BulkEntryTable.tsx and DailyBulkEntryTable.tsx are referenced in the file summaries as being updated with inline editing for normal hours, overtime, and leave toggles. However, the actual diff content for BulkEntryTable.tsx and DailyBulkEntryTable.tsx is not shown — only their summaries in frontend-file-summaries.txt are present. The CalendarPage.tsx restoration appears complete and correct. The constraint of not modifying other pages/backend appears respected based on the diff.",

      "reason": "The diff does not include actual code changes to BulkEntryTable.tsx or DailyBulkEntryTable.tsx — only their descriptions appear in the file summaries text file. Without seeing the actual diff for these files, it cannot be confirmed that inline editing controls for normal hours, overtime, and leave toggles were fully restored to v227 format.",
